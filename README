This is the bot i created for the Google-sponsored AI Challenge 2011 (Ants).
I know it's a mess, but it made me win the first place.

You can read my post mortem explaining what the code does at http://xathis.com/posts/ai-challenge-2011-ants.html (See: https://web.archive.org/web/20160828072456/http://xathis.com/posts/ai-challenge-2011-ants.html)

Everything interesting is located in Strategy.java
